### This project explores Bayes' Rule for e-mail spam filtering through use of the Bayesian classifier 

Developed knowledge of:

* The concept of a predictive classification model
* Formulating a classification model as a conditional probability problem
* Using Bayes' Rule to derive an expression that can be used for making predictions
* How the naïve Bayesian classifier works
* How to use naïve Bayes to classify texts
* Implementing a classifier using Python's scikit-learn library
